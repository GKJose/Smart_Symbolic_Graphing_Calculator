</h3>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">Xcas</span> can operate on expressions in the expression editor or
subexpressions of the expression. To understand subexpressions and
how to select them, it helps to know that <span style="font-family:monospace">Xcas</span> stores
expressions as <span style="font-style:oblique">trees</span>.</p><p>A tree, in this sense, consists of objects called nodes. A node can
be connected to lower nodes, called the children of the node. Each
node (except one) will be connected to exactly one node above it,
called the parent node. One special node, called the root node, won’t
have a parent node. Two nodes with the same parent nodes are called
siblings. Finally, if a node doesn’t have any children, it is called
a leaf. This terminology comes from a visual representation of a
tree,
</p><div class="center">
<img src="cascmd_en005.png">
</div><p>
which looks like an upside-down tree; the root is at the
top and the leaves are at the bottom.</p><p>Given an expression, the nodes of the corresponding
tree<a id="hevea_default41"></a> are the functions, operators, variables
and constants. The children of a function node are its arguments, the
children of an operator node are its operands, and the constants and
variables will be the leaves. For example, the tree for sin(2*<span style="font-style:italic">x</span> +
<span style="font-style:italic">y</span>) will look like
</p><div class="center">
<img src="cascmd_en006.png">
</div><p>
A subexpression<a id="hevea_default42"></a> of an expression will be a
selected node together with the nodes below it. For example, both
2*<span style="font-style:italic">x</span> and 2*<span style="font-style:italic">x</span>+<span style="font-style:italic">y</span> are subexpressions of sin(2*<span style="font-style:italic">x</span>+<span style="font-style:italic">y</span>), but <span style="font-style:italic">x</span>+<span style="font-style:italic">y</span> is
not.</p><p>A subexpression of the contents of the expression editor can be
selected with the mouse; the selection will appear white on a black
background. A subexpression can also be chosen with the keyboard
using the arrow keys. Given a selection:
</p><ul class="itemize"><li class="li-itemize">
The up arrow will go to the parent node.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The down arrow will go to the leftmost child node.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The right and left arrows will go to the right and left sibling nodes.
</li><li class="li-itemize">The control key with the right and left arrows will switch the
selection with the corresponding sibling.
</li><li class="li-itemize">If a constant or variable is selected, the backspace key will delete
it. For other selections, backspace will delete the function or
operator, and another backspace will delete the arguments or operands.
</li></ul><p>You can use the arrow keys to navigate the tree structure of an
expression, which isn’t always evident by looking at the expression
itself. For example, suppose you enter <span style="font-family:monospace">x*y*z</span> in the editor.
The two multiplications will be a different levels; the tree will look
like
</p><div class="center">
<img src="cascmd_en007.png">
</div><p>
If you select the entire expression with the up arrow and then go to
the <span style="font-family:monospace">M</span> menu to the right of the line and choose eval, then the
expression will look the same but, as you can check by navigating it
with the arrow keys, the tree will look like
</p><div class="center">
