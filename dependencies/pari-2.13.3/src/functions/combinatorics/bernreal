 $B_n$, as \kbd{bernfrac}, but $B_n$ is returned as a real number
 (with the current precision). The argument $n$ should be a nonnegative
 integer. The function slows down as the precision increases:
 \bprog
 ? \p1000
 ? bernreal(200000);
 time = 5 ms.
 ? \p10000
 ? bernreal(200000);
 time = 18 ms.
 ? \p100000
 ? bernreal(200000);
 time = 84 ms.
