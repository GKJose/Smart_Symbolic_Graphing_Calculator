Function: real
Section: conversions
C-Name: greal
Prototype: G
Help: real(x): real part of x.
Doc: real part of $x$. When $x$ is a quadratic number, this is the
 coefficient of $1$ in the ``canonical'' integral basis $(1,\omega)$.

 ? real(3 + I)
 %1 = 3
 ? x = 3 + quadgen(-23);
 ? real(x) \\ as a quadratic number
 %3 = 3
 ? real(x * 1.) \\ as a complex number
 %4 = 3.5000000000000000000000000000000000000
