 \noindent
 Many of the conversion functions are rounding or truncating operations. In
 this case, if the argument is a rational function, the result is the
 Euclidean quotient of the numerator by the denominator, and if the argument
 is a vector or a matrix, the operation is done componentwise. This will not
 be restated for every function.
