Help: ellisomat(E, {p=0}, {fl=0}): E being an elliptic curve over a number
 field K, return a list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of
 elliptic curves defined over K and K-isogenous to E, with the corresponding
 isogenies from E and their dual, and the matrix of the isogeny degrees between
 the curves. If the flag fl is 1, the isogenies are not computed, which saves
 time. If p is set, it must be a prime number: in this case only isogenies of
 degree a power of p are considered.
Doc:
 Given an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a number field $K$, compute
 representatives of the isomorphism classes of elliptic curves defined over
 $K$ and $K$-isogenous to $E$. We assume that $E$ does not have CM over $K$
 (otherwise that set would be infinite).
 For any such curve $E_i$, let $f_i: E \to E_i$ be a rational isogeny
 of minimal degree and let $g_i: E_i \to E$ be the dual isogeny; and let $M$
 be the matrix such that $M_{i,j}$ is the minimal degree for an isogeny $E_i
 \to E_j$.

 The function returns a vector $[L,M]$ where $L$ is a list of triples
 $[E_i, f_i, g_i]$ ($\fl  = 0$), or simply the list of $E_i$ ($\fl = 1$,
 which saves time). The curves $E_i$ are given in $[a_4,a_6]$ form and the
 first curve $E_1$ is isomorphic to $E$ by $f_1$.

 If $p$ is set, it must be a prime number; in this which case only isogenies of
 degree a power of $p$ are considered.

 Over a number field, the possible isogeny degrees are determined by
 Billerey algorithm.
