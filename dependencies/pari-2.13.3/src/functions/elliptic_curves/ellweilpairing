Help: ellweilpairing(E, P, Q, m): computes the Weil pairing of the two points
 of m-torsion P and Q on the elliptic curve E.
Doc: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a finite field and $m \geq 1$
 be an integer. This function computes the Weil pairing of the two $m$-torsion
 points $P$ and $Q$ on $E$, which is an alternating bilinear map.
 More precisely, let $f_{m,R}$ denote a Miller function with
 divisor $m[R] - m[O_E]$; the algorithm returns the $m$-th root of unity
 $$\varepsilon(P,Q)^m \cdot f_{m,P}(Q) / f_{m,Q}(P),$$
 where $f(R)$ is the extended evaluation of $f$ at the divisor $[R] - [O_E]$
 and $\varepsilon(P,Q)\in \{\pm1\}$ is given by Weil reciprocity:
 $\varepsilon(P,Q) = 1$ if and only if $P, Q, O_E$ are not pairwise distinct.
