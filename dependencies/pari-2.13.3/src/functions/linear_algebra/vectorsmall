Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: vecteursmall
Prototype: GDVDE
Help: vectorsmall(n,{X},{expr=0}): VECSMALL with n components of expression
 expr (X ranges from 1 to n) which must be small integers. By default, fills
 with 0s.
Doc: creates a row vector of small integers (type \typ{VECSMALL}) with $n$
