Help: qfperfection(G): rank of matrix of xx~ for x minimal vectors of a gram
 matrix G.
Doc: $G$ being a square and symmetric matrix with integer entries
 representing a positive definite quadratic form, outputs the perfection rank
 of the form. That is, gives the rank of the family of the $s$ symmetric
 matrices $vv^t$, where $v$ runs through the minimal vectors.

 The algorithm computes the minimal vectors and its runtime is exponential
 in the dimension of $x$.
