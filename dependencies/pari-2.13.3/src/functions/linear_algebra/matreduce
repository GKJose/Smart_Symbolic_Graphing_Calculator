Help: matreduce(m): reduce the factorization matrix m to canonical form
 (sorted first row with unique elements)
 matrix.
Doc: let $m$ be a factorization matrix, i.e., a 2-column matrix whose
 columns contains arbitrary ``generators'' and integer ``exponents''
 respectively. Returns the canonical form of $m$: the
 first column is sorted with unique elements and the second one contains the
 merged ``exponents'' (exponents of identical entries in the first column  of
 $m$ are added, rows attached to $0$ exponents are deleted). The generators are
 sorted with respect to the universal \kbd{cmp} routine; in particular, this
 function is the identity on true integer factorization matrices, but not on
 other factorizations (in products of polynomials or maximal ideals, say). It
 is idempotent.

 For convenience, this function also allows a vector $m$, which is handled as a
 factorization with all exponents equal to $1$, as in \kbd{factorback}.
