C-Name: rnfconductor0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: rnfconductor(bnf,T,{flag=0}): conductor of the Abelian extension
 of bnf defined by T. The result is [conductor,bnr,subgroup],
 where conductor is the conductor itself, bnr the attached bnr
 structure, and subgroup the HNF defining the norm
 group (Artin or Takagi group) on the given generators bnr.gen. If flag is set,
 return a bnr modulo deg(T), attached to Cl_f / (deg(T))
Doc: given a \var{bnf} structure attached to a number field $K$, as produced
 by \kbd{bnfinit}, and $T$ an irreducible polynomial in $K[x]$
 defining an \idx{Abelian extension} $L = K[x]/(T)$, computes the class field
 theory conductor of this Abelian extension. If $T$ does not define an Abelian
 extension over $K$, the result is undefined; it may be the integer $0$ (in
 which case the extension is definitely not Abelian) or a wrong result.

 The result is a 3-component vector $[f,\var{bnr},H]$, where $f$ is the
 conductor of the extension given as a 2-component row vector $[f_0,f_\infty]$,
 \var{bnr} is the attached \kbd{bnr} structure and $H$ is a matrix in HNF
 defining the subgroup of the ray class group on the ray class group generators
 \kbd{bnr.gen}; in particular, it is a left divisor of the diagonal matrix
 attached to \kbd{bnr.cyc} and $|\det H| = N = \deg T$.

 If \fl is set, return $[f,\var{bnrmod}, H]$, where
 \kbd{bnrmod} is now attached to $\text{Cl}_f / \text{Cl}_f^N$, and $H$ is as
 before since it contains the $N$-th powers. This is useful when $f$ contains
 a maximal ideal with huge residue field, since the corresponding tough
 discrete logarithms are trivialized: in the quotient group, all elements have
 small order dividing $N$. This allows to work in $\text{Cl}_f/H$ but no longer
 in $\text{Cl}_f$.

 \misctitle{Huge discriminants, helping rnfdisc} The format $[T,B]$ is
 also accepted instead of $T$ and computes the conductor of the extension
 provided it factors completely over the maximal ideals specified by $B$,
 see \kbd{??rnfinit}: the valuation of $f_0$ is then correct at all such
 maximal ideals but may be incorrect at other primes.

Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{rnfconductor}{GEN bnf, GEN T} when $\fl =
 0$.
