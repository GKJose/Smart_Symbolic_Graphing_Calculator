Function: export
Section: programming/specific
Help: export(x{=...},...,z{=...}): export the variables x,...,z to the parallel world.
Doc: Export the variables $x,\ldots, z$ to the parallel world.
 Such variables are visible inside parallel sections in place of global
 variables, but cannot be modified inside a parallel section.
 \kbd{export(a)} set the variable $a$ in the parallel world to current value of $a$.
 \kbd{export(a=z)} set the variable $a$ in the parallel world to $z$, without
 affecting the current value of $a$.
 \bprog
 ? fun(x)=x^2+1;
 ? parvector(10,i,fun(i))
   ***   mt: please use export(fun).
 ? export(fun)
 ? parvector(10,i,fun(i))
