Help: parforeach(V,x,expr1,{r},{expr2}): evaluates in parallel the expression
 expr1 for all components x of V. If the formal variables r and expr2 are
 present, evaluate sequentially expr2, in which x and r are replaced by the
 successive arguments and corresponding values.
Doc: evaluates in parallel the expression \kbd{expr1} in the formal
 argument $x$, where $x$ runs through all components of $V$.
 If $r$ and \kbd{expr2} are present, evaluate sequentially the expression
 \kbd{expr2}, in which the formal variables $x$ and $r$ are replaced
 by the successive arguments and corresponding values. The sequential
 evaluation ordering is not specified:
